# CNN-F Model Notes

This is a link to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11035) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PeterWang512/CNNDetection) associated with the CNN-F model. 

As outlined in the ReadME file of the Github repository, I followed [Section 2: Quick Start](https://github.com/PeterWang512/CNNDetection?tab=readme-ov-file#2-quick-start). This involved running the `demo.py` or `demo_dir.py` files depending on if you want to evaluate the model on single images or whole datasets.
